## Development

Built autonomously by [gh-dev-factory](https://github.com/thunderclawai/gh-dev-factory) — an AI development pipeline that turns GitHub Issues into working code.

See [Epic #1](https://github.com/thunderclawai/ocean-outlaws/issues/1) for the roadmap.

## Mobile Rework (iOS-first)

A full mobile strategy and technical roadmap for the Expo + React Three Fiber + Supabase port is documented here:

- [docs/mobile-rework-roadmap.md](docs/mobile-rework-roadmap.md)

Current execution priority is to validate the ocean shader on-device, extract reusable game logic, and deliver a first playable iOS vertical slice.

Mobile bootstrap is now available in [`mobile/`](mobile/) with an initial Expo + R3F scene and HUD overlay prototype.
